# dev-pipeline-backend:dev — Unified Feature Development Pipeline

## The Conductor

`dev-pipeline-backend:dev` orchestrates the entire feature lifecycle through a GSD-inspired sub-command chain. It invokes existing skills (brainstorm, writing-plans, verify, etc.) — it does NOT replace them.

**Design doc:** `docs/plans/2026-03-10-dev-pipeline-design.md`

## Sub-Command Chain

```
dev-pipeline-backend:dev              → This file (routes to current phase or starts new feature)
dev-pipeline-backend:intake       → Classify, scope, create MANIFEST, determine tier
dev-pipeline-backend:discover     → /brainstorm + TeamCreate (NOVEL tier)
dev-pipeline-backend:plan         → Agent research + architecture decisions (decisions get LOCKED here)
dev-pipeline-backend:document     → 5-layer docs + /writing-plans for wave execution plans
dev-pipeline-backend:build        → Task execution (tier-driven) + /investigate + /safe-migrate
dev-pipeline-backend:validate     → /verify + /security-review + QA + production data re-audit
dev-pipeline-backend:handover     → Frontend design + /frontend-handover (conditional)
dev-pipeline-backend:ship         → /publish workflow
dev-pipeline-backend:pause        → Explicit pause with detailed handoff document
```

## Routing Logic

When `dev-pipeline-backend:dev` is invoked, determine the action:

### 1. Check for Active Feature

```
Search for active MANIFEST:
  Glob: docs/*/.dev/MANIFEST.md
  Read each, check Status field
```

**If active MANIFEST found (Status: In Progress or Paused):**
- Read MANIFEST → get `Current Phase` and `pause_context`
- Read `docs/[feature]/prompt-transitions/[current_phase].md`
- If prompt-transition file missing:
  ```bash
  node ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/../shared/tools/dev-pipeline-tools.js validate-entry [current_phase] docs/[feature] --plugin backend
  ```
  - If FAIL: show issues to user, suggest re-running previous phase's TRANSITION
  - If PASS with warnings: proceed but warn user about missing context
  - Read MANIFEST + CURRENT_STATUS.md + design doc as fallback context
- Present: "You're building **[feature]**, currently at **[phase]**."
- If paused: show pause context (what was done, what remains, blockers)
- Suggest: "Next action: [specific next step]"
- Route to the current phase's sub-command

**If multiple active MANIFESTs found:**
- List all with feature name, phase, last updated
- Ask user which to resume or if starting a new feature

**If no active MANIFEST:**
- Route to `dev-pipeline-backend:intake`

### 2. Parse Arguments

| Input | Route |
|-------|-------|
| `dev-pipeline-backend:dev` (no args) | Resume active feature OR start intake |
| `dev-pipeline-backend:dev "description"` | `dev-pipeline-backend:intake` with idea dump mode |
| `dev-pipeline-backend:dev --spec path/to/spec.md` | `dev-pipeline-backend:intake` with tech spec mode |
| `dev-pipeline-backend:dev --handover feature-name` | `dev-pipeline-backend:intake` with frontend handover mode |
| `dev-pipeline-backend:dev --bug "description"` | `dev-pipeline-backend:intake` with bug/issue mode |
| `dev-pipeline-backend:phase-name` | Jump to specific phase (must have MANIFEST) |

### 3. Phase Validation

Before routing to any phase, validate prerequisites:

| Phase | Requires |
|-------|----------|
| INTAKE | Nothing |
| DISCOVER | MANIFEST exists (INTAKE complete) |
| PLAN | DISCOVER gate approved |
| DOCUMENT | PLAN gate approved, decisions locked |
| BUILD | DOCUMENT gate approved, wave execution plans exist |
| VALIDATE | BUILD gate approved, tests passing |
| HANDOVER | VALIDATE gate approved |
| SHIP | VALIDATE or HANDOVER gate approved |
| PAUSE | Active feature in any phase |

If prerequisites not met, tell user what's missing and suggest the correct phase.

## Complexity Tiers

Determined during INTAKE. Drives behavior across ALL phases.

| Tier | When | Example | Brainstorm | Build |
|------|------|---------|------------|-------|
| **KNOWN** | Pattern exists in codebase | CRUD endpoint, landing page | Quick | Sequential |
| **COMBINATION** | Combines known patterns | Booking cancellation | Standard | Wave-parallel |
| **NOVEL** | No existing pattern, needs research | AI curriculum generator | Deep + TeamCreate | Expert-team waves |

## Entry Modes

| Mode | Starting Point | Description |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| **Idea dump** | INTAKE → DISCOVER | Rough idea, needs full brainstorm |
| **Tech spec** | INTAKE → DISCOVER (post-spec) | Spec exists, skip to post-spec brainstorm |
| **Frontend handover** | INTAKE → HANDOVER | Backend done, need frontend work |
| **Bug/issue** | INTAKE → BUILD (/investigate) | Something broken, investigate flow |

## Phase Pattern (Every Phase)

```
RESEARCH → EXECUTE → DOCUMENT → GATE
```

1. **RESEARCH:** Gather context (agents, codebase, files)
2. **EXECUTE:** Do the work (skills, agents, decisions)
3. **DOCUMENT:** Update docs, MANIFEST, trackers
4. **GATE:** Present results, get approval

### Standard Gate

```
PHASE GATE: [phase name]
  Summary: what was accomplished
  Artifacts: files created/updated
  Decisions: locked/deferred
  Custom criteria: [from PLAN]
  Next phase: what happens next
  Options:
    1. Approve → advance
    2. Revise → address feedback
    3. Pause → dev-pipeline-backend:pause
```

## Domain-Triggered Agents

MANIFEST tracks domains. Agents dispatch based on domains, NOT phases.

| Domain | Agents | Skills |
|--------|--------|--------|
| `auth` | `security-engineer`, `rails-expert` | `/security-review` |
| `database` | `master-backend-ai-rails`, `postgres-pro` | `/safe-migrate`, `/production-data-audit` |
| `payments` | `security-engineer`, `backend-service-developer` | `/security-review` |
| `students` | `security-engineer` (COPPA) | `/security-review` |
| `real-time` | `websocket-engineer` | — |
| `email` | — | `/email` |
| `external-api` | `backend-service-developer` | `/security-review` |
| `performance` | `performance-engineer`, `database-optimizer` | — |
| `background-jobs` | `rails-expert` | — |
| `api-design` | `api-designer` | — |
| `frontend` | `frontend-developer`, `ui-designer` | `/frontend-handover` |

## State Management

### MANIFEST Location
`docs/[feature]/.dev/MANIFEST.md` — pipeline state, decisions, waves, acceptance criteria

### Prompt Transitions
`docs/[feature]/prompt-transitions/[phase].md` — context bridge between phases

### Feature Docs
```
docs/[feature]/
├── .dev/
│   ├── MANIFEST.md
│   └── reports/
├── prompt-transitions/
├── 00_MASTER_PLAN.md
├── 01_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
├── CURRENT_STATUS.md
├── tasks/
│   ├── TASK_01_[name].md
│   ├── WAVE_01_PLAN.md
│   └── ...
└── api/
    └── [FEATURE]_API_CONTRACT.md
```

## Context Protection

- **Subagent isolation:** Heavy work runs in subagents. Agents write to files, orchestrator reads files.
- **Session boundaries:** Each phase designed to complete in one session. Artifacts persist.
- **Resumption:** MANIFEST + prompt-transitions enable pickup at any point.

## Error Handling

### BUILD Auto-Escalation
```
Task fails → self-fix (1 retry) → /investigate → 3-strikes → dev-pipeline-backend:pause
```

### Cross-Phase Regression
If any phase discovers design needs revision:
- Go back to earlier phase (e.g., PLAN → DISCOVER)
- MANIFEST tracks regressions
- Decision status changes from `locked` to `revisited`

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Skipping to BUILD without DOCUMENT gate | Every phase must complete its gate before advancing |
| Not checking for active MANIFEST before starting new feature | Always Glob for existing MANIFESTs first |
| Advancing past a gate without user approval | Gates are MANDATORY stops — no auto-advancing (except INTAKE) |
| Starting a phase without reading its prompt-transition | Prompt transitions carry critical context from the previous phase |
| Mixing up tiers mid-pipeline | Tier is set in INTAKE and drives ALL subsequent phases |
| Not updating MANIFEST after phase completion | MANIFEST is the source of truth — stale state breaks resumption |

## Rules

- **NEVER skip phases** — each phase builds on the previous
- **NEVER start code without DOCUMENT complete** — wave execution plans must exist
- **ALWAYS invoke /prompt-generator at phase transitions** — context bridges are mandatory
- **ALWAYS update MANIFEST at every phase** — pipeline state must be accurate
- **Respect gates** — user approval required before advancing
- **Tier drives behavior** — KNOWN/COMBINATION/NOVEL changes how every phase operates
